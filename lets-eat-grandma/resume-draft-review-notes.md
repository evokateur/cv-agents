##Areas of Expertise

- Could I use fewer categorizations or is *more is better* for the robots? I see [examples](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/jaydeeps-cv/vdkxtzrbbyzn
) with fewer categories, such as *Programming*, *Libraries/Frameworks*, and *Tools/Platforms*, that seem to make sense. Is this open to my discretion?


##Professional Experience

###Multiemployer

- Really nice! I will just make sure everything makes perfect sense and tweak as necessary.

###Aditional Experience

- Could I leave out this section? I do not know all the start and end months.

- On the other hand, if I can estimate the start month for the Center for the Built Environment (on the U.C. Berkeley campus) should I indicate that I worked there part time and primarily while in school?

##Education

- Cognitive Science was in interdisciplinary program, combining Computer Science, Linguistics, Philosophy of Mind, Cognitive Psychology, and Neuroscience. Should anything other than "Cognitive Science" be in parentheses?
