> What was your inspiration for choosing this career path? What do you like most about working in your desired industry/role? (Min. 200 characters)

It pretty much chose me. I have a special interest in software development and love making elegant, maintainable code.

I like systems and I like understanding them, building them, making them better. This necessitates a clear understanding of the goal of the system and what the parts are. To that end I really enjoy modeling domains, understanding what the important things are and how they're related.

> What are your greatest concerns regarding your job search documents? What should your resume writer know about your experience and your job search goals? (Min. 50 characters)

Lots of experience but the wrong kind. Not having worked with people who think like me. Not having experience with specific languages, tools, and frameworks but being able to show that I understand principles and that's what's actually important. Letting the right people, those that value bottom up system thinking, know that I'm here. It would be great to work in an ASD friendly environment.

> What is your proudest moment or biggest accomplishment in the last 10-15 years of your career and why? (Min. 100 characters)

Nothing specific. I'm very happy when I've managed to put things together well, I've captured the domain correctly, the software does what it's supposed to, and it will be easy to change.
