With over 20 years of experience in backend development, I’ve built and maintained production systems across a wide range of business needs — from API design and third-party integrations to legacy system maintenance and pragmatic performance improvements.

Today, I’m focused on modernizing my stack and working with established teams who follow current best practices in software development, DevOps, and architecture. I bring a disciplined, problem-solving mindset — and I’m eager to work alongside experienced engineers to sharpen my skills in today’s leading tools and workflows.

**Strengths & Experience:**

* Deep experience with REST APIs, database design, and integration with legacy systems
* Proficient in PHP (Laravel), PostgreSQL, Git, and AWS basics
* Strong debugging, system design, and practical optimization skills

**Currently focused on:**

* Python/FastAPI and the modern Python ecosystem
* Node.js and TypeScript-based backend services
* LLM integration and tooling
* DevOps tooling (Docker, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, infrastructure-as-code)

I thrive when working from well-defined use cases and domain models, and I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully while adapting to modern development practices through real-world collaboration.
