Professional Experience
LEAD SOFTWARE DEVELOPER	Apr 2009 – Jul 2024
MULTIEMPLOYER, INC | BERKELEY, CA
●	I tried to organize your bullet points into similar thoughts so we can re-organize them into at most five bullet points, please look over how I group them and let me know if this makes sense. In the group about application development think if it makes sense to keep these as separate bullet points, because it seems like they could be told as different stories of applications that you developed for different clients?

●	General information about the company	

A small company. The owner originally wrote stuff in FoxPro and wanted rewrite things in PHP...
The customers were unions of all types. Electricians, brick layers, actors (the Screen Actors Guild was once a customer), some teamsters, etc.

●	Use Case Analysis & Domain Modeling
o	–  Worked with clients and domain experts to gather use cases 
o	–  Designed well structured domain models from use cases 
o	–  Designed relational schema to work with business objects (or the other way around, as necessary) 
▪	
●	Application Development
o	–  Developed back-end implementation of use cases in coordination with UI designers 
o	–  Developed RESTful APIs to support external client applications 
o	–  Developed applications to track union membership and dues 
o	–  Developed applications to generate employer remittances (and ACH files) for fringes and deductions based on various measurements of work completed 

●	Data Integration
o	–  Wrote shell and SQL scripts to extract, transform, and integrate legacy data from various sources (CSV, fixed width, Access MDB files) 
▪	
●	Code Quality & Maintenance
o	–  Debugged and refactored many lines of legacy code 
o	–  Strived to write clean and orthogonal code, in which concerns (such as data access, business rules, and  UI interaction) are separated 
o	–  Instituted and maintained Gitlab instance on VPS 

●	Environment & Deployment
o	–  Created a Vagrant development environment to handle numerous heterogeneous project structures and technical dependencies 
o	–  Wrote shell scripts for deployment, managed passwordless SSH access to deployment servers 
o	–   Developed a system using cron and shell scripts to manage recurring enterprise tasks (generally having to do with data integration)

RESEARCH ASSISTANT & PROGRAMMER	Month 2007 – Jan 2012
CENTER FOR THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT | LOCATION
●	 Please come ready to explain to me your most important 4 responsibilities or projects
●	We will discuss during the consultation of this is a position that we want to keep up here or move down into additional experience, depends on how relevant it is

This was part-time, sporadic work on a building survey application written in an obsolete language. The greatest accomplishment was staying up all night cleaning viruses from the server because they were using it for downloaded movies.

Additional Experience
This “additional experience” section is a strategy to shorten your resume. It is helpful to include older or not-as-relevant experience that warrants a quick mention but not a full entry
For both experience sections, the dates should be included in a “Month-Year” format to ensure ATS readability.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER | SYNOVATION | LOCATION	Month 2001 – Month 2002
A Java shop, but I worked on legacy MS Access apps (no longer relevent)

PROGRAMMER | AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE | LOCATION	Month 1998 – Month 2001
Worked with MS Access and VB6 (no longer of any relevence) but also MS SQL Server (of relevence, but yuck)

Education
- Let’s only include university and junior college education. 
- If no degree was obtained, what was the number of credit hours completed toward the degree?

I completed the credit hours required for a B.A. but did not file the paperwork to complete an incomplete, so I'm short one course.

BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE, COMPUTER SCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGY, LINGUISTICS
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY | BERKELEY, CA

WHAT WAS THIS?

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ
CALCULUS, LINEAR ALGEBRA, DISCRETE MATHEMATICS 
2005 - 2005

I could not decide which university to go to, at first, so I started here and took math requirements

 
Questions for Cover Letter:
●	Which job are we prioritizing? 

I have re-sorted them

    
---> #1: https://app.welcometothejungle.com/dashboard/jobs/jC38Zme6
        "Strong understanding of database management and object-oriented programming"
        "Write well designed, testable, performant, and efficient code"

o	 #2: https://app.welcometothejungle.com/dashboard/jobs/wZg6DPIW
        "Production experience designing and implementing APIs using GraphQL or REST"
        I really *want* to be working with GraphQL, but I do have experience with REST

o	 #3: https://app.inclusively.com/job/zoy10BN4N7bJRPlG
        "Write well-crafted, well-tested, readable, maintainable code"
        "Promote appropriate tech and engineering best practices"

-	 #4: https://app.welcometothejungle.com/dashboard/jobs/VFdnR29r)
        This has very good examples of things I like, such as
         - "Has a knack for problem-solving and thinking from first principles"
         - "Holds a high bar for quality and simplicity and takes pride in their work"
        I've already applied with sub-optimal C.V., so its ship has probably sailed

●	Why is this role the next step in your career?
o	From your intake  It pretty much chose me. I have a special interest in software development and love making elegant, maintainable code. I like systems and I like understanding them, building them, making them better. This necessitates a clear understanding of the goal of the system and what the parts are. To that end I really enjoy modeling domains, understanding what the important things are and how they're related.

●	Why is this company appealing to work at?
o	From your intake  
o	Letting the right people, those that value bottom up system thinking, know that I'm here. It would be great to work in an ASD friendly environment.
o	team with established best practices and methodologies. 
o	I’m interested in working with use cases and helping to establish well defined domain models.

●	An example of…

o	Please come ready to discuss a strong example from your professional career that you believe displays the qualities you can bring to the table for your next job.

o	From your intake  Nothing specific. I'm very happy when I've managed to put things together well, I've captured the domain correctly, the software does what it's supposed to, and it will be easy to change.
o	I’ll ask you to share it with me using this format:
