- developed applications for
  - employer dues/fringes remittances
  - member dues collection and accounting
  - dues/fringes reciprocity, from fund to fund

- REST APIs - [lineco]
  - [zenith]
  - [ctww]

- Application APIs for mobile apps
  - bac

- designed integration processes, implemented with shell and sql scripts
  - from flat files
  - from csv files
  - from other databases

- data modeling
  - employer union remittances
  - dues collection
  - ach files

- set up gitlab, maintained gitlab
  - originally from source, then from omnibus
  - migrated from mysql to postgresql (then upgraded from last version suppporting mysql to current)

- established build processes for all the aps

- integrating wordpress with PHP frameworks with version control strategies

- established git workflows and release tag schema

- developed a system of shell scripts to run various tasks for various applications in cron

- mentored developers with coding principles and organization
- deciphered and untangled lots legacy code

- advocated clean, orthogonal, maintainable code

- worked with AWS: EC2, RDS

what I came up with

"Worked with clients and domain experts to gather use cases",
"Designed well structured domain models from use cases",
"Designed relational schema to work with business objects (or the other way around, as necessary)",
"Developed back-end implementation of use cases in coordination with UI designers",
"Wrote shell and SQL scripts to extract, transform, and integrate legacy data from various sources (CSV, fixed width, Access MDB files)",
"Debugged and refactored many lines of legacy code",
"Strived to write clean and orthogonal code, in which concerns (such as data access, business rules, and UI interaction) are separated",
"Instituted and maintained Gitlab instance on VPS",
"Developed RESTful APIs to support external client applications",
"Developed applications to track union membership and dues",
"Developed applications to generate employer remittances (and ACH files) for fringes and deductions based on various measurements of work completed",
"Created a Vagrant development environment to handle numerous heterogeneous project structures and technical dependencies",
"Wrote shell scripts for deployment, managed passwordless SSH access to deployment servers",
"Developed a system using cron and shell scripts to manage recurring enterprise tasks (generally having to do with data integration)"

what [Mrs Davis](https://chatgpt.com/c/679a9a6e-d854-8012-88ea-f7f026a4911a) came up with

– Developed enterprise applications for employer remittances for dues/fringes, member dues collection
and accounting, and local-to-local reciprocity.
– Designed and implemented REST APIs for third-party integrations.
– Built and maintained application APIs for client mobile apps.
– Engineered data integration processes using shell scripts and SQL, handling imports from flat files,
CSV, Access MDBs, and other relational databases.
– Led data modeling efforts for employer union remittances, dues collection, and ACH transactions.
– Managed and maintained GitLab, initially setting it up from source and later transitioning to Omnibus,
including a migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL.
– Established and optimized build pipelines for multiple applications, ensuring reliable deployments.
– Integrated WordPress with PHP frameworks while implementing version control strategies.
– Designed and enforced Git workflows and a structured release tag schema.
– Developed a system of shell scripts to automate application tasks via cron jobs.
– Mentored developers in coding best practices, software architecture, and maintainability.
– Refactored and untangled legacy codebases, advocating for clean, modular, and maintainable code.
– Worked with AWS services, including EC2 and RDS, for cloud-based application hosting and database
management.
