# MultiEmployer Inc

I joined company in the Spring of 2009, the first PHP developer. I left in the Summer of 2024. I was the one continuous back-end developer during that time.

## Company Organization

- The principal owner

- A front-end web developer/designer, who worked with the principal and with clients to gather requirements and come up with website designs.

- Myself, the back-end developer. I would be introduced after the front-end had a design ready, and I was expected implement the back-end functionality to support it. Use cases were not documented, and often not fully developed. It would take a lot of work to fully understand what the use cases were meant to be.

- Other developers, not working continuously. The principal owner tended to work with them directly.
