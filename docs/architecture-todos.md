# Architecture TODOs

- [ ] Develop plan for including personal projects in KB (or separate collection, see
below)
  - The current knowledge base includes summaries of prior employer work, but does not include any private or proprietary source code.

## Recommended Research

- [ ] Multi-KB support via collections
  - Assigning collection IDs per knowledge base
  - Switching vector stores per context (e.g. dev history vs companies vs soft skills)
  - Runtime switching using tool wrapper or dynamic RagTool instantiation
- [ ] Redaction layer or metadata tagging
- [ ] File browsing or structured doc listing
- [ ] Advanced agent prompting with memory/context tuning
