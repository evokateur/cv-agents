## Project Restructuring to CrewAI Architecture (August 2025)

**Summary:** Completed restructuring CV optimization project to follow recommended CrewAI project structure and updated documentation to reflect architectural changes.

**Key Changes:**
- Migrated to CrewAI hybrid YAML/Python configuration approach
- Implemented @CrewBase decorator pattern with @agent, @task, and @crew decorators
- Created optimizer/config/ directory with agents.yaml and tasks.yaml configurations  
- Added CLI interface (kickoff_crew.py) for running crew with JSON/YAML config
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect new architecture
- Removed residual template files from CrewAI project generator

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Sequential process workflow with three agents: job_analyst, candidate_profiler, cv_strategist
- Custom Jinja2 environment with LaTeX-safe delimiters for template rendering
- ChromaDB vector database integration for RAG-based knowledge queries
- Pydantic models for data validation and structured outputs
- Configurable AI models per agent via environment variables

**Files Updated:**
- CLAUDE.md - Updated AI-Powered CV Optimization section and CLI usage
- optimizer/crew.py - Main crew implementation with CrewAI decorators
- optimizer/config/agents.yaml - YAML agent configurations
- optimizer/config/tasks.yaml - YAML task configurations with dependencies
- kickoff_crew.py - Command-line interface for crew execution
- cv_agents.py - Test runner with hardcoded inputs

**Result:** Project now follows CrewAI best practices with proper separation of concerns, hybrid configuration, and comprehensive documentation.
