## Project Restructuring to CrewAI Architecture (August 2025)

**Summary:** Completed restructuring CV optimization project to follow recommended CrewAI project structure and updated documentation to reflect architectural changes.

**Key Changes:**

- Migrated to CrewAI hybrid YAML/Python configuration approach
- Implemented @CrewBase decorator pattern with @agent, @task, and @crew decorators
- Created optimizer/config/ directory with agents.yaml and tasks.yaml configurations  
- Added CLI interface (kickoff_crew.py) for running crew with JSON/YAML config
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect new architecture
- Removed residual template files from CrewAI project generator

**Architecture Highlights:**

- Sequential process workflow with three agents: job_analyst, candidate_profiler, cv_strategist
- Custom Jinja2 environment with LaTeX-safe delimiters for template rendering
- ChromaDB vector database integration for RAG-based knowledge queries
- Pydantic models for data validation and structured outputs
- Configurable AI models per agent via environment variables

**Files Updated:**

- CLAUDE.md - Updated AI-Powered CV Optimization section and CLI usage
- optimizer/crew.py - Main crew implementation with CrewAI decorators
- optimizer/config/agents.yaml - YAML agent configurations
- optimizer/config/tasks.yaml - YAML task configurations with dependencies
- kickoff_crew.py - Command-line interface for crew execution
- cv_agents.py - Test runner with hardcoded inputs

**Result:** Project now follows CrewAI best practices with proper separation of concerns, hybrid configuration, and comprehensive documentation.

## RAG Tool Implementation and Vector Database Management (August 2025)

**Summary:** Implemented comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool integration with improved vector database management and validation utilities.

**Key Changes:**

- Created `VectorDbBuilder` class for robust vector database creation and management
- Implemented `optimizer/utils/vector_utils.py` with Chroma DB validation and utilities
- Refactored RAG tool instantiation in `agents.py` with proper error handling
- Added configurable knowledge base and vector database paths via environment variables
- Enhanced configuration management with absolute path handling

**Architecture Implementation:**

- **Vector Database Management**: Automated validation and rebuilding of ChromaDB vector stores
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Seamless RAG tool setup with fallback creation when needed
- **Configuration Enhancement**: Added `knowledge_base_abspath` and `vector_db_abspath` properties to Config class
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation of vector DB state before tool instantiation
- **Tool Naming**: Named RAG tool as "CandidateKnowledgeBase" for better context

**Files Updated:**

- `optimizer/agents.py` - Refactored `get_rag_tool()` method with VectorDbBuilder integration
- `optimizer/vector_builder.py` - Renamed class and improved parameter naming for consistency
- `optimizer/utils/vector_utils.py` - Utility functions for Chroma DB validation and management
- `config.py` - Added knowledge base and vector DB path configuration properties
- `docs/architecture-todos.md` - Created new file documenting future enhancement plans

**Technical Details:**

- Vector DB validation checks for required Chroma files (collections, embeddings, index, lock)
- Automatic rebuilding when vector DB is invalid or missing
- Consistent absolute path handling throughout the configuration system
- Simplified RAG tool configuration with OpenAI embeddings and Chroma backend

**Result:** Enhanced RAG tool reliability with proper vector database lifecycle management and improved error handling for knowledge base operations.
