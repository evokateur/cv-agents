## Semantic Search Tool Implementation (August 2025)

**Summary:** Replaced RagTool with custom SemanticSearchTool to provide better integration with existing ChromaDB vector database and improved source file path extraction.

**Key Issues Resolved:**

- **Pydantic Validation Error**: Fixed "arg_schema Field required" error by properly configuring BaseTool inheritance and schema definition

- **Task Prompt Updates**: Enhanced candidate profiling task instructions to leverage semantic search results and FileReadTool integration
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Created focused functionality tests for vector database and semantic search operations

**Architecture Implementation:**

- **Custom Tool Development**: Created SemanticSearchTool with proper Pydantic schema configuration and LangChain BaseTool inheritance
- **Metadata Handling**: Implemented robust source path extraction supporting both 'url' and 'source' metadata keys
- **Agent Integration**: Maintained "CandidateKnowledgeBase" tool name for seamless agent prompt compatibility
- **Test Coverage**: Added simple functionality tests that verify actual behavior rather than object construction

**Files Updated:**

- `optimizer/tools/semantic_search_tool.py` - Custom semantic search tool implementation with fixed Pydantic validation

- Tests verify actual semantic search functionality and source path presence in results

**Result:** Semantic search tool now correctly returns document chunks with full source file paths, enabling agents to read complete documents when needed. All tests pass and functionality is ready for production use.

## VectorDbBuilder to KnowledgeBaseEmbedder Refactoring (August 2025)

**Summary:** Successfully renamed VectorDbBuilder class to KnowledgeBaseEmbedder to better reflect its purpose of embedding the knowledge base directory in ChromaDB, along with comprehensive updates to variable names and file organization.

**Key Changes:**

- Renamed `VectorDbBuilder` class to `KnowledgeBaseEmbedder` for clearer semantic meaning
- Updated all variable references from `builder` to `embedder` throughout the codebase
- Renamed `optimizer/vector_builder.py` to `optimizer/knowledge_embedder.py`
- Resolved ChromaDB singleton conflict issues in testing environment
- Enhanced force rebuild functionality with proper vector database cleanup

**Architecture Implementation:**

- **Class Renaming**: `KnowledgeBaseEmbedder` better describes the class purpose of embedding knowledge base content
- **Variable Consistency**: Updated all variable names (`self.builder` → `self.embedder`) for clarity
- **File Organization**: Renamed primary class file to match the new class name
- **Test Stability**: Fixed ChromaDB singleton conflicts by adjusting force rebuild behavior
- **Enhanced Cleanup**: Added vector database deletion logic for proper force rebuilds

**Files Updated:**

- `optimizer/knowledge_embedder.py` - Renamed from `vector_builder.py` with enhanced force rebuild handling
- `optimizer/agents.py` - Updated import and variable names, changed `force_rebuild=True` to `force_rebuild=False`

- `tests/test_semantic_search_tool.py` - Test file that revealed ChromaDB singleton issues

**Technical Details:**

- Enhanced `build_if_needed()` method with proper vector DB deletion before force rebuilds
- Fixed ChromaDB singleton conflict: "An instance of Chroma already exists with different settings"
- Root cause: `force_rebuild=True` caused test conflicts by attempting to rebuild existing databases
- Solution: Set `force_rebuild=False` for normal operations, preserving existing vector database
- Force rebuild enhancement includes proper cleanup but ChromaDB client lifecycle limitations remain

**Result:** Successfully completed class and file renaming with improved semantic clarity. All tests pass and ChromaDB singleton conflicts resolved. Force rebuild functionality enhanced with proper cleanup, though ChromaDB client lifecycle constraints limit same-process rebuilds.

## Kickoff Script Refactoring and JobAnalysisTest Crew Implementation (August 2025)

**Summary:** Successfully refactored `optimizer/kickoff.py` to use dictionary-based crew dispatching and implemented JobAnalysisTest crew with manual CrewAI construction to avoid framework auto-loading conflicts.

**Technical Details:**

- Dictionary dispatcher: `CREW_FUNCTIONS = {"CvOptimizer": kickoff_cv_optimizer, "JobAnalysisTest": kickoff_job_analysis_test}`
- Manual crew construction avoids @CrewBase auto-loading that requires all YAML agents/tasks to be defined
- JSON schemas validate required inputs (job_posting_url, candidate_cv_path for CvOptimizer; job_posting_url, output_directory for JobAnalysisTest)
- Module execution pattern (`python -m scripts.job_analysis_test`) resolves optimizer package imports
- JobAnalysisTest crew runs single job_analyst agent with job_analysis_task for faster testing

**Result:** Successfully created flexible crew dispatching system that supports both full CvOptimizer crew and streamlined JobAnalysisTest crew. All Makefile targets work correctly and CrewAI framework limitations resolved through manual crew construction approach.

## CandidateProfilingTest Crew Implementation (August 2025)

**Summary:** Successfully implemented CandidateProfilingTest crew to test candidate profiling task in isolation, featuring fake job analysis agent and simplified configuration with automatic file path resolution.

- **Simplified Inputs**: Reduced to `candidate_cv_path` and `output_directory` parameters, assuming job analysis output exists at standard location
- **File Loading Pattern**: Fake job analysis task loads from `{output_directory}/job_analysis.json` automatically
- **Template Fix**: Corrected CrewAI template interpolation from `{ candidate_cv_path }` to `{candidate_cv_path}` (removed spaces)
- **Manual Crew Construction**: Used direct Crew instantiation without @CrewBase decorator to avoid YAML auto-loading conflicts

**Files Updated:**

- `optimizer/crew.py` - Added CandidateProfilingTest class with internal fake agent and task definitions
- `optimizer/kickoff.py` - Added `kickoff_candidate_profiling_test()` function with schema validation

- `optimizer/config/tasks.yaml` - Fixed template variable interpolation by removing spaces around `candidate_cv_path`
- `Makefile` - Added `candidate-profiling-test` target using module execution pattern

**Technical Details:**

- Fake job analysis task returns JobPosting object loaded from pre-existing job analysis output file
- Candidate profiling task receives fake job analysis context and processes actual CV file
- Template interpolation uses standard `{}` syntax (not Jinja2 `{{ }}` delimiters)
- Schema validation ensures `candidate_cv_path` is required input parameter
- Test successfully reads candidate CV (Wesley Hinkle) and performs semantic search for relevant projects

**Result:** Functional candidate profiling test crew that isolates the candidate profiling task for focused testing. Successfully reads CV files, loads job analysis context from standardized output location, and generates candidate profiles with semantic search integration. All naming aligned with task-based conventions.
