## Project Overview

### Initial Functionality: CV Generation
Generates my CV using JSON/YAML data and a LaTeX Jinja template.

### Extended Functionality: Resume Optimization
An agentic solution for resume optimization. It would involve processing a job posting and extracting the information, reading from a knowledge base containing information about the type of work I've done, evaluating how well I might fit in the position, and finally creating optimized C.V. data for the position.
